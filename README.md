# School_District_Analysis
##Overview
A school district employee has asked for help with cleaning, sorting, and analyzing data in regards to the 15 high schools in the district. The analyis provided should give the district a better idea how things like budgeting and school size may affect students academic performance. After an initial analysis the district employee lets you know that the grades for 'Thomas High School' 9th grade have been tampered with. I new analysis needed to be made excluding the tampered data for an acurate/honest analysis.
